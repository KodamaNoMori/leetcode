Beyond those ones, iter() and next() can be useful once you're comfortable working with iterators/generators.
isinstance, issubclass, and type are important for type-checking, but leetcode is never gonna require that.
open is important for reading/writing files.
filter and map can be helpful sometimes but are mostly redundant thanks to list comprehensions and generator expressions.
